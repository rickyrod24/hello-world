# hello-world
This is my first foray into GitHub... Hello World!

I'm a citizen of the world. I love to travel and do it as often as possible. Just got back from Hong Kong and the Philippines. I'll be in LA soon and then off to Greece. Ahead of that are Costa Rica and possibly a northern Italy trip in there sometime. 

Anyways, that's life and I love living it. Till next time!
